Price Prediction
OBJECTIVE: - PRICING A RENTAL PROPERTY ON AIRBNB IS A CHALLENGING TASK FOR THE OWNER AS IT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR THE PLACE. ON THE OTHER HAND, CUSTOMERS HAVE TO EVALUATE AN OFFERED PRICE WITH MINIMAL KNOWLEDGE OF AN OPTIMAL VALUE FOR THE PROPERTY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING TO RECOMMEND THE PROPERTY OWNERS WITH AN APPROXIMATE EVALUATED PRICE.

METHODS EMPLOYED: PRE-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES USING PANDAS, VISUALIZATION USING MATPLOT AND SEABORN, REGRESSION ML ALGORITHMS 

OUTCOME: - AN ACCURACY OF ABOUT 71% WAS ACHIEVED FOR THE PREDICTION OF THE PRICE.
